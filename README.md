Open source Learning Management System (LMS) by [CourseBit].

Development is in early prototyping phases. Installation can be done for evaluation purposes, but keep in mind that many features have not been implemented yet.

## Release Date

Inkstand is developed in my free time, however I plan on releasing a beta version of Inkstand in **November 2015**. 

 - Version 0.5: November 2015 **Alpha**
 - Version 1.0: May 2016 **Beta**
 - Version 1.5: TBD

## Goals

Inkstand aims to be the modern solution for online learning. 

 - Enhanced user learning experience on any device.
 - Full library of learning activities (discussion forums, quizzes, SCORM, etc.)
 - Easy application flow that does not require many "click-throughs" to get to content.
 - Robust features that do not clutter the learning experience.
 - Flexible system that can be extended modularly.
 - Utilize [Composer] for plugin and dependency management.
 - Solid performance and quick page load times.
