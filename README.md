# Inkstand

Open source Learning Management System (LMS) by [CourseBit].

Development is in early prototyping phases. Installation can be done for evaluation purposes, but keep in mind that many features have not been implemented yet.

## Release Date

Inkstand is developed in my free time, however I plan on releaseing a beta version of Inkstand in **November 2015**. 

 - Version 0.5: November 2015 **Beta**
 - Version 1.0: May 2016 **Stable**
 - Version 1.5: TBD

## Goals

Inkstand aims to be the modern solution for online learning. 

 - Enhanced user learning experience on any device.
 - Full library of learning activities (discussion forums, quizzes, SCORM, etc.)
 - Easy application flow that does not require many "click-throughs" to get to content.
 - Robust features that do not clutter the learning experience.
 - Flexible system that can be extended modularly.
 - Free to download and install on most hosting. While Inkstand uses modern tools, my goal is to create a distibution that requires little technical knowledge to install and can be setup on shared hosting.
 - Solid performance and quick page load times.

#### Bug reporting:
If you run into a bug while evaluating/QA testing Inkstand, please [create a new issue]. Detail the problem, how to reproduce, and any other useful info.

#### Translating:
I only speak English and code, so Inkstand will need translators. As long as you are proficient in another language you can help. Please contact me via [my website] if you are interested.

### Why Contribute?
Inkstand is open source, thus it is free for anyone to download and install. By providing a quality learning system that is accessible, we are enhancing the experience of learners everywhere.
